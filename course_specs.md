# Software Carpentry for Public Sector Professionals

## Step 1: Brainstorming (The What?)

1. What problem(s) will participants learn how to solve (**Core Skills**)?
  * Learn to work with `.csv, .xlsx` and similar raw data files with `python` or `R`.
    * See: (Formating Data in Spreadsheets)[https://datacarpentry.org/spreadsheets-socialsci/] This might provide a clear jump-off location for a more tailored lesson. 
  *  Develop reproducible cleaning scripts. A contrast from the Data Carpentry lesson that uses (Open Refine)[https://datacarpentry.org/openrefine-socialsci/]
  * Exploratory data analysis (Similar to this but tailored to public sector folks?)[https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/]
    * After learning how to work with "common file types", and loading data into preferred software tool, we can:
      * Data wrangling basics in preferred language.
      * Simple Data Viz.
      * Producing figures for reporting.
  * Reporting tools:
    * RMarkdown and Sweave
    * Python notebooks (not very familiar wth these...)
  * **Other Topics:**
    * SQL integration
    * STATA and SPSS support
## Step 2(a): Who is this course for?
1. What is the expected educational level of your audience? 
  * all sorts of levels, targeting data professionals in non-profit and government organizations.  
2. What type of exposure do your audience members have to the technologies you plan to teach?
  * Minimal experience with open source data software tools.
3. What types of tools do they already use?
  * Works with data at some capacity (excel files --> SQL)
  * Might heavily rely on proprietary software to conduct work.
  * Some R or Python.
4. What are the pain points they are currently experiencing?
  * Unable to reproduce external data requests or ETL procedures currently being used in-house. 
  * Reporting is not reproducible or version controlled. 
  * data tables and figures are not versioned controlled.
5. What types of data does your target audience work with? What are the commonalities in the datasets your target audience will encounter?
  * Administrative data containing user logs.
  * Programmatic data and logs containing geographical and aggregated information of program and clients.

* **Learner-1**: Learner-1 is the only data analyst in a government organization and wants to leverage open source tools to conduct their work. They have been using some proprietary software and want to begin doing their work using R or Python. 
* **Learner-2**: Learner-2 is a data manager in their organization...

## Step 2(b): Background Knowledge and Goals of Learners?

* What type of exposure do your audience members have to the technologies you plan to teach?
* What types of tools do they already use? 
* What are the pain points they are currently experiencing?
* What types of data does your target audience work with? What are the commonalities in the datasets your target audience will encounter?

## Step 3: Defining the skills that this lesson will focus on.

**Skills**: [Use this for reference](https://cdh.carpentries.org/deciding-what-to-teach.html#skills-list) 

**Skills required**: 
**What will the participants need to have in order to be successful**
* Beginners course! Low entry-bar
* Install appropriate software on local machine.
## Step 4: Designing Challenges

## Step 5: How are the concepts connected? (Content Development)

**Change to Episodes and Lesson formulation as [seen here.](https://cdh.carpentries.org/our-curriculum-structure.html#episodes)

**Curriculum Description**

*Example: Whether it's prices in the stock market, the number of visitors to a website, or the population of rabbits in a forest, many phenomena that we'd like to model with statistics involved numbers tracked over time. In this course, you'll be introduced to the field of stochastic processes, an area of probability studying systems that change over time. You'll learn about common statistical models such as random walks, Poisson processes, and Markov chains, as well as being introduced to the exponential and gamma distributions. These provide the fundamentals for many statistical methods common in finance, biology, and many other fields.*

**Learning Objectives**

* Be introduced to statistical models often used to represent a system changing over time: **random walks**, **Poisson processes**, and **Markov chains**
* Learn about two new statistical distributions, the exponential and the gamma, that are important in modeling .
* Gain experience with probability concepts such as random variables, distributions, expected value, and variance
* Practice using simulation to understand and answer probability problems
